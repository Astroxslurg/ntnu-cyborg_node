              The purpose of this project is to visualise the activity of the
              neurons used by NTNU Cyborg. We want to show people how
              interesting and complex the int eractions in the cell culture can
              be. The website is to be used as exposure for NTNU Cyborg, and can
              be further developed in the future.

              two people are from Computer Science, one is from Informatics and
              two are from Cybernetics and Robotics.
